title: "Create k-means clusters for k=4 for the Liver Disorders Data Set at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Liver+Disorders . Explain the input parameters you provided for the clustering algorithm. Plot the fitted cluster centers using a different color.  Finally assign the cluster membership for the points to the nearest cluster center.  Color the points according to their cluster membership."

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

liver <- read.csv("~/Downloads/Final exam/6/Liver_data.csv")
str(liver)
summary(liver)

x<-liver[,1:2]

plot(x,pch=19,xlab=expression(x[1]),ylab=expression(x[2]))

fit<-kmeans(x, 4)
points(fit$centers,pch=19,col="blue",cex=2)

library(class)
knnfit<-knn(fit$centers,x,as.factor(c(-1,1)))
points(x,col=1+1*as.numeric(knnfit),pch=19)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
